# Pytorch_Model-Object_Detection-YOLOv3
This is a Pytorch implementation of state-of-art YOLOv3 object detection algorithm.
## How to run:

    1. Clone repository
    2. Place your images in the 'imgs' folder
    3. Download cfg,weights from YOLOv3 website and convert them to Keras model as described below.
    4. Open the spyder and run detector.py and run the code for images or run video.py for videos/Webcam. output will be saved in the 'det' folder.
    
Note: I have provided cfg, weights ,yolov3.h5,anchors and pallete file in the repostory .
